ALU UVM Verification Project

üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the functional verification of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM).
The ALU is a fundamental digital block that performs arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, and comparison.

The goal of this project was to build a reusable, scalable, and coverage-driven UVM testbench to verify the correctness of ALU functionality under all possible input conditions.


üéØ Objectives

Verify logic gate ALU operations.

Build a SystemVerilog UVM-based testbench with constrained-random stimulus.

Ensure thorough functional coverage and assertion-based verification.

Achieve 100% functional and assertion coverage.
